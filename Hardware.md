# RME Fireface UCX

Enter class-compliant mode:

> Connect the UCX to power and switch it on. Turn the encoder
knob in Channel mode until SU appears in the display. Press the knob once to activate Level mode.
Turn the knob until CC is shown in the display, then press and hold the encoder until the display
shows on (pressing the knob again will make the display show oF, indicating CC mode is inactive).
The unit will reboot, all LEDs will light up, after which it will be in Class Compliant mode.

The unit may be in 'C8' mode, which means DAW channels 1+2 are copied to outputs 7+8 as well. To restore 1:1 routing,
select SU again, now find 'CA' mode, keep encoder pressed.

__N.B.__ Phantom power settings cannot be accessed on the device, but must be copied via TotalMix on macOS or Windows to the device first.
Six (?) setups can be recalled within the SU sub-menu.
